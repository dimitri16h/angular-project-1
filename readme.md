# Purpose for this Project: 

I am making this project to learn new technologies and learn about new development environments. Up to this point, a large portion of my full stack development experience has been with a LAMP stack - Linux, Apache, Mysql/Postgres, and PHP - with various frameworks thrown in such as Laravel and Vue.js.

# New Technologies in this Project:

In this project, I will be working with a Windows OS, and plan to use the Angular framework with TypeScript for the front end and the Spring Boot framework with Java for the backend, it will also be my first time using the Visual Studio Code IDE on a larger project. Below is a brief list of technologies I will be using, I will continue to add to it as it grows.

* Angular 7.0.4
* Angular CLI 7.0.7
* Node 10.14.1
* npm 6.4.1
* SpringBoot 2.1.1
* Java 8

# Type of Application

In order to learn the new technologies, I decided a good first application to start with is a to-do application. The application will allow users to make new accounts, sign in and out, and add tasks they wish to accomplish to a list. Later, once they have a list created, they should be able to edit the tasks, mark them as complete, or delete them completely.
